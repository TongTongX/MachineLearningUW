Week 6
Quiz: Deep Learning
1. Having good non-linear features can allow us to learn very accurate linear classifiers. Linear classifiers are useful, but they cannot represent anything.
2.
	A. x1 OR x2 OR NOT x3, can be represented, example weights: 0.5,1,1,-0.6
	B. x1 AND x2 AND NOT x3, can be represented, example weights: -1.5,1,1,-0.6
	C. x1 OR (x2 AND NOT x3), can be represented
3. Image D.
	(x1 AND x2), weights: -1.5,1,1,
	(NOT x1 AND NOT x2) = NOT (x1 OR x2), weights: 0.5,-1,-1
	(z1 OR z2), weights: -0.5,1,1
4. Features in computer vision act like local detectors. By learning non-linear features, neural networks have allowed us to automatically learn detectors for computer vision, rather than combining hand-created features that already exist.
5. a deep neural network trained on this data.
6. a simple classifier trained on this data, using deep features as input, which were trained using ImageNet data.
